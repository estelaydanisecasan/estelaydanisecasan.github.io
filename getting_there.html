							<p>The easiest way to get there is by car from Madrid. There are many possibilities to rent a car from the airport or from the city center, and it will give you more independance and freedom if you want to take the chance to spend some days in Spain (the wedding will be in a very rural area and public transport is almost nonexistent). If you do so, we recommend you to take the highway <strong>A5</strong> (no tolls) from Madrid to <strong>Navalmoral de la Mata</strong>. There you should take the national road <strong>EX-119</strong> to Jarandilla de la Vera.</p>
							<p>There is also the possibility of taking a train that goes straight from <strong>Atocha-Cercanias</strong> at the very center of Madrid, to Navalmoral de la Mata. We can help you getting the tickets if you choose this option. From there, we can help you to arrive to your accomodation during the morning of the 13th and back to Navalmoral de la Mata on the afternoon of the 14th.</p>
							
							<p>In Jarandilla you can find several hotels and houses for renting, but it is quite a popular destination during the summer, so our recommendation is to find and book something as soon as possible. The best would be to stay in Jarandilla, or as close as possible, so you don't need the car to go back after the party. The area of La Vera is a very beautiful area famous for its Nature and gastronomy, and fresher than the average Spanish town at that time of the year (since it's in the mountains), but still you will find plenty of natural pools in the rivers to cool off. <a href="http://www.aturive.com">Here</a> you can read more about La Vera, if you fancy staying for some days more. <a href="http://www.turismoextremadura.com/viajar/turismo/en/explora/Plasencia/">Plasencia</a>, with its Gothic cathedral and old town, and <a hfer="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_de_Gredos"> Sierra de Gredos</a> are also very close.</p>
